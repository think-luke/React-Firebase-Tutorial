This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The root directory is called React-Firebase-Tutorial.

# Getting started
### Firebase is an easy to use PaaS (Platform as a Service) product backed by Google.

<br>

There are many products out there like MongoDB, Parse, Heroku, AWS Amplify, etc.,
<br>
but Firebase offers great features out of the box to get you started in minutes!

<br>

## One product offered by Firebase is a database called [Firestore.](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

## Firestore or Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL database
For those who are familiar with backend development - yes, NoSQL means less querying power.
<br>
However, if you are working on a smaller application or internal tool, Firestore is awesome!

<br>

## Pros
You can build and deploy a quality application without re-inventing the wheel.
- No need to set up a SQL database
- No need for ORM tools
- User auth is built-in
- Security is offloaded to Google
- Connect to your frontend with one small file
- Import and invoke built-in methods in seconds

## Cons
However, if you are looking to scale rapidly and expand, Firestore has limitations.
- Weaker querying power
- Complex relationships are difficult to manage
- Reversing the order of data happens in the frontend
- More expensive than other providers as userbase grows
- You are responsible for backing up your database elsewhere
