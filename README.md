# Getting Started with Firebase and React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The root directory is called react-firebase.

# Step one

## Set up Firebase

Let's start with the [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/).

Put simply, Firebase is a serverless backend platform/framework. It only executes code when an event is triggered. You can write scripts to interact with other products like Google Sheets and you can also send HTTPS requests to store and retrieve data. It's really fast, convenient and pretty cool!

Alright, now that you're at the website, create an account if you haven't or log in to access the dashboard.

### Dashboard

This is what the Firebase dashboard looks like:

Begin by clicking the "Add Project" card under Your Firebase Projects.
You will see the following page and you can enter a name for your project:

Once you click continue, step 2 is confirming your Google Analytics selection. We are going to disable this to quickly move forward. However, please investigate Google Analytics depending on your project requirements. Here is a link to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision).

It will take a little bit for the project to get initialized. Now's a good time to check your coffee or tea!

If you got coffee or tea, yay! If you got water, also yay!
Ok once your project gets initialized, you will land on this page.

There are so many forms and steps involved, but we are almost done!
The next thing you need to do is click on the web app ```</>``` button under the "Get started by adding Firebase to your app" header.

The following short form will appear - you just need to give your app a nickname and leave the Firebase Hosting box unchecked for now. If you need Firebase Hosting, check out [this link](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting?gclid=CjwKCAjws--ZBhAXEiwAv-RNLy56zPOphuzMTXKtA3V11PFk3EwZ8uA2x19qUDrp2rgkbxws2pGWGBoCpe8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). This is the final form you need to fill out:
