# Getting Started with Firebase and React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The root directory is called react-firebase.

# Step one

## Set up Firebase

Let's start with the [Firebase website](https://firebase.google.com/).

Put simply, Firebase is a serverless backend platform/framework. It only executes code when an event is triggered. You can write scripts to interact with other products like Google Sheets and you can also send HTTPS requests to store and retrieve data. It's really fast, convenient and pretty cool!

Alright, now that you're at the website, create an account if you haven't or log in to access the dashboard.

### Dashboard

This is what the Firebase dashboard looks like:

Begin by clicking the "Add Project" card under Your Firebase Projects.
You will see the following page and you can enter a name for your project:

Once you click continue, step 2 is confirming your Google Analytics selection. We are going to disable this to quickly move forward. However, please investigate Google Analytics depending on your project requirements. Here is a link to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision).
